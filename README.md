The University Project Hub is a Node.js backend application designed to manage university student projects, including data storage, retrieval, and interaction through a RESTful API. It supports scalable development with MongoDB as the primary database and Express.js as the server framework.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================
University Project Hub is a backend application developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It is designed to manage and streamline the storage and access of university student project data. With a RESTful API interface, it allows integration with frontend systems for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting project-related information.
This system serves as a foundation for academic institutions to digitize and centralize project submissions, tracking, and management. It is modular, scalable, and ready for deployment. The backend is equipped with support for environment-based configurations using dotenv and enables secure cross-origin interactions using cors, making it ideal for modern web app development.
Whether you're building a full-stack student portal or a simple project archive system, University Project Hub can serve as a reliable starting point
